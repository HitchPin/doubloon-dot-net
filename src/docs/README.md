# Doubloons

A type-safe way to do math with money. The Doubloon holds the precious numerical values safe, while only permitting operations that are guaranteed to not cause any floating point arithmetic issues, mixing of currencies, off-by-one-penny errors, or errors that result from too little or too much rounding.
